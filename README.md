## stuff for the C^3 Seidenstrasse project

Arduino code, gnuplot .plot files and raw accelerometer data collected from the datalogger capsule
I built for the 31c3 version of the "Seidenstrasse" pneumatic tube system. 

## Usage/Requirements

You will need the Arduino SDCard library for the Adafruit datalogger shield. 
A recent version of GNUplot for the .plot files. 

## Notes

 * The data is pretty, but it's kind of hard to make any assumptions about what actually went on.
   The Arduino stack was secured inside the capsule by lots of bubble-wrap and electrical tape.
   It's entirely possible(in fact, almost certain) that it jostled around inside, shifted on its own axes, etc. One person on Twitter (@exe) has already pointed out that he thinks the Y-Axis data is horribly off-scale.
